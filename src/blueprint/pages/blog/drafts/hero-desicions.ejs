esentially we get to this point:

<%- require("/blueprint/partials/components/tabs/index.ejs")({
    nav_items: [
        {
            id: 'preview',
            text: 'Preview',
            selected: true
        },
        {
            id: 'html',
            text: 'HTML',
        }
    ],
    tab_items: [

            {
                id: 'preview',
                content: require("/blueprint/pages/docs/components/card/stash.ejs")(),
                selected: true
            },
            {
                id: 'html',
                content: '',
            }
    ]
}) %>

and we are now faced witht he fact this is still a little oto much overhead and we need ot 
pass in one object per tab item.

awesome I'm glad we did this we get to MEMOIZATION!  (cracking up thinking about Oprah audience clapping)... what if we fed AI every eisode of
Oprah and ... or JErry springer...
