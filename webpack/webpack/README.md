How to phrase it cleanly (for docs + marketing)

Blueprint Build System is a standardized frontend workflow for building modern websites.
It provides a repeatable structure for templates, partials, components, styles, and JavaScript bundling — with an emphasis on maintainability and long-term evolution.

Then you add:

The current reference implementation is powered by Webpack, but the system itself is designed to be portable across build tools.

That one sentence is huge. It tells people you’re not married to Webpack, you’re building a framework mindset.

The above is ChatGPT, which is interesting, because over the past few years I actually started using the term **“marry”** in my mind — as in, make a commitment. I tried different approaches, different tools, and I kept returning to this setup.

The main purpose of this build system is that it feeds partials that are then transformed into functional PHP components. These components are then concatenated using functional programming techniques. I’ve tried some of the modern tools. I’ve tried the hands-off “vibe-coding” approach. And I still come back to this setup — knowing how things work, staying close to the details, and continually refining the system over time. And back to the whole “marriage” thing: I believe PHP / MySQL / JavaScript, for my needs and desires, will serve me for the rest of my life. So I decided to go deep into learning functional concepts in these languages instead of wasting my time chasing the hot new toy.

I’ve been on the web since the 14.4 kbps days, so when I noticed a photography website I was developing — running full Bootstrap, unoptimized, on shared hosting — still loaded almost instantly, I had to stop and ask myself: **what am I actually trying to do here?**

I was trying to create a system that would allow me to manage enough websites that I could generate a living wage for myself, and turn my focus back to music and the arts.

I also believe this setup can become the base for a curriculum, which is why there is a corresponding tutorial. My entire mission over the past year or two has been to create the learning resource I wish I had five years ago. I’ve read the books and followed along on Front End Masters and other platforms, and I still feel like there’s a need for something like this. At the very least, it introduces concepts and provides practical demonstrations of how to apply them.

On a side note, for years I struggled with low self-esteem when it came to my coding abilities, and I tried really hard to beef up my skillset. Truthfully, my career goal was never “programmer.” I think there is some overlap with my interests and skillsets, and my desire to learn and pass on knowledge is what has driven me to this point.

The time has come to take the leap.
